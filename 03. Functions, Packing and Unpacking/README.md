Function is reusable block of code.
'def' keyword -- then name and indent 4spaces
Scope - global context, local context.
*args - pass as many parameters to the function as we want.
Unpacking - multiple assignment - opposite of packing 
Key Features of Python Functions
First-Class Functions:
Functions can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.
Dynamic Typing:
Function parameters and return types do not need to be explicitly declared. Types are determined at runtime.
Default Arguments:
Functions can have default values for parameters, which are set when the function is defined.
Variable Argument Lists:
Functions can accept an arbitrary number of positional (*args) and keyword (**kwargs) arguments.
Closures and Nested Functions:
Functions can be nested within other functions, and inner functions can capture and use variables from the outer function (closures).
Decorators:
Functions can be extended or modified using decorators, which are higher-order functions that wrap other functions.
Exception Handling:
Functions can raise and handle exceptions directly within the function body.
Lambda Functions:
Python supports lambda functions for creating short, anonymous functions, which are limited to a single expression.
Global and Nonlocal Variables:
The global and nonlocal keywords allow modification of variables in the global or outer function scope within a function.
Indentation-Based Structure:
Python uses indentation to define the scope of functions and other blocks of code, which is strictly enforced.
