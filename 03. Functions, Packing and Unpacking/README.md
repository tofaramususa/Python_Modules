## What is a Function?
A function in Python is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces, allowing for code reuse and better organization.

### Example
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

## Defining Functions
Functions are defined using the `def` keyword, followed by the function name, parentheses `()`, and a colon `:`. The function body is indented with 4 spaces.

### Example
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b
```

### Function Scope
Scope determines where variables can be accessed within a program. In Python, there are two main scopes:

- **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside any function.
- **Local Scope**: Variables defined within a function.

### Example
```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def modify():
    x = 5  # Local variable
    print(x)

modify()  # Output: 5
print(x)  # Output: 10 (global variable remains unchanged)
```

## Function Arguments

### Positional Arguments
Arguments passed to a function based on their position.

### Example
```python
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

print(subtract(10, 5))  # Output: 5
```

### Keyword Arguments
Arguments passed by explicitly specifying the parameter name.

### Example
```python
def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

print(subtract(b=5, a=10))  # Output: 5
```

### Default Arguments
Parameters can have default values that are used if no argument is passed.

### Example
```python
def greet(name="Guest"):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

print(greet())       # Output: Hello, Guest!
print(greet("Bob"))  # Output: Hello, Bob!
```

### Variable-Length Arguments (`*args` and `**kwargs`)
Python functions can accept an arbitrary number of arguments using `*args` (for positional arguments) and `**kwargs` (for keyword arguments).

### Example
```python
def add(*args):
    return sum(args)

print(add(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 6

def display(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

display(name="Alice", age=30)
# Output:
# name: Alice
# age: 30
```

## Packing and Unpacking

### Packing
Packing refers to the process of grouping multiple values into a single variable using `*args` or `**kwargs`.

### Example
```python
def pack(*args):
    print(args)

pack(1, 2, 3)  # Output: (1, 2, 3)
```

### Unpacking
Unpacking is the reverse process, where values from a sequence (like a list or tuple) are assigned to multiple variables.

### Example
```python
numbers = (1, 2, 3)
a, b, c = numbers  # Unpacking
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3
```

### Multiple Assignment
Multiple assignment allows for unpacking in a single line.

### Example
```python
a, b, c = 1, 2, 3
print(a, b, c)  # Output: 1 2 3
```

### Using `*` for Unpacking
The `*` operator can be used to unpack the remaining elements in a sequence.

### Example
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
a, *b, c = numbers
print(a)  # Output: 1
print(b)  # Output: [2, 3, 4]
print(c)  # Output: 5
```

## Key Features of Python Functions

### First-Class Functions
In Python, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, and assigned to variables.

### Example
```python
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

def call_func(func, value):
    return func(value)

print(call_func(greet, "Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### Dynamic Typing
Python functions do not require explicit type declarations for parameters or return types. Types are determined at runtime.

### Example
```python
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

print(add(1, 2))       # Output: 3
print(add("a", "b"))   # Output: ab
```

### Closures and Nested Functions
Functions can be nested within other functions, and inner functions can capture and use variables from the outer function. This is known as a closure.

### Example
```python
def outer_func(message):
    def inner_func():
        print(message)
    return inner_func

my_func = outer_func("Hello, World!")
my_func()  # Output: Hello, World!
```

### Decorators
Decorators are a powerful feature that allows you to extend or modify the behavior of functions without changing their code.

### Example
```python
def decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print("Something is happening before the function is called.")
        func()
        print("Something is happening after the function is called.")
    return wrapper

@decorator
def say_hello():
    print("Hello!")

say_hello()
# Output:
# Something is happening before the function is called.
# Hello!
# Something is happening after the function is called.
```

### Lambda Functions
Lambda functions are small anonymous functions defined with the `lambda` keyword. They are limited to a single expression.

### Example
```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8
```

### Exception Handling
Functions can raise and handle exceptions within their body using `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks.

### Example
```python
def divide(a, b):
    try:
        return a / b
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        return "Cannot divide by zero"

print(divide(10, 2))  # Output: 5.0
print(divide(10, 0))  # Output: Cannot divide by zero
```

### Global and Nonlocal Variables
- **Global Variables**: Variables declared outside a function. Use the `global` keyword to modify them within a function.
- **Nonlocal Variables**: Variables in the nearest enclosing scope. Use the `nonlocal` keyword to modify them within a nested function.

### Example
```python
x = 10  # Global variable

def outer():
    x = 5  # Local to outer()

    def inner():
        nonlocal x
        x = 20
        print(x)  # Output: 20

    inner()
    print(x)  # Output: 20

outer()
print(x)  # Output: 10
```

### Indentation-Based Structure
Python uses indentation to define the scope of functions and other blocks of code. The standard is 4 spaces per indentation level.

### Example
```python
def example():
    if True:
        print("Indented with 4 spaces")
```

## Advanced Function Techniques

### Function Caching with `functools.lru_cache`
Python provides a way to cache the results of expensive function calls using the `lru_cache` decorator from the `functools` module.

### Example
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=32)
def fibonacci(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(10))  # Output: 55
```

### Partial Functions with `functools.partial`
The `partial` function from the `functools` module allows you to fix a certain number of arguments of a function and generate a new function.

### Example
```python
from functools import partial

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

double = partial(multiply, 2)
print(double(5))  # Output: 10
```
