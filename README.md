# Python_Modules

## Overview

This repository explores and utilizes the advanced features of Python. It includes self-made notes on each topic and sometimes python code files.

### Topics Covered

1. **Variables, Types, Loops**  
   Explore the fundamental building blocks of Python programming, including variable assignments, data types, and loops.

2. **Lists**  
   Dive into Python lists, their operations, methods, and how they can be used to store and manipulate data efficiently.

3. **Tuples**  
   Learn about tuples, which are immutable sequences, and understand when and why to use them in your programs.

4. **Functions, Packing, and Unpacking**  
   Master function definitions, arguments, return values, and the concepts of packing and unpacking arguments.

5. **Python Sequences**  
   Understand sequence data types in Python, such as strings, lists, and tuples, and how to manipulate them.

6. **Dictionaries**  
   Study Python dictionaries, key-value pairs, and the powerful operations you can perform on them.

7. **Dunder Main**  
   Learn about the `__main__` function and how to structure Python scripts for standalone execution.

8. **Object-Oriented Programming**  
   Delve into the principles of OOP in Python, including classes, objects, inheritance, and polymorphism.

9. **Write Better Python**  
   Improve your Python code by following best practices, such as code readability, efficiency, and maintainability.

10. **Date and Times**  
   Work with dates and times in Python using modules like `datetime` and `time`.

11. **Regular Expressions**  
   Harness the power of regular expressions in Python for pattern matching and string manipulation.

12. **File Input/Output**  
   Learn how to read from and write to files, handle file exceptions, and work with different file formats.

13. **CSV and JSON**  
   Work with CSV and JSON data formats, including reading, writing, and parsing these formats in Python.

14. **Databases (ORM)**  
   Discover how to interact with databases using Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) in Python, focusing on Peewee and SQLite.

15. **Python Testing**  
   Understand the principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and how to write and run tests using the `unittest` module.

16. **Comprehensions**  
   Explore list comprehensions, dictionary comprehensions, and set comprehensions to write concise and efficient Python code.

17. **Decorators**  
   Learn about decorators in Python, including how they work, why they are useful, and how to create your own.

18. **Type Hinting**  
   Study type hinting in Python to make your code more readable and maintainable, with examples on how to annotate your functions and variables.

19. **Functional Programming**  
   Dive into functional programming techniques in Python, including lambda functions, map, filter, reduce, and more.
