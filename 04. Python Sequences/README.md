What can you do with sequences:
Iterating - term iterable -- you can loop over it - for in loop
for each element in a sequence do this aciton
fstrings allows use to replace variables in strings
Enumerate function - iteratable and count. Enumerate object. Get back the index and current element
Ranges - python method --> range[] start, stop, step. Allows us to create an array, number, 

part 2 - Sequence Operations
Mutable and immutable
Slices - option of a sequence - [start:stop:step] -- creates a new sequence 
Len,min,max -- work for all sequences but have to be the same type. 
Membership testing - using 'in' and 'not in' comparisons
Work with all sequences
Sequences are objects and have methods. for example - count -- exact matches. Can use index function too. 
Concatenation and multiplication -- make two objects together.
use the plus sign -- just add them together. Multiplication multiple times.
