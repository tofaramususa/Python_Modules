Test Driven Development:

- Add a docstring to your entire program. Three chevrons >>>
- Doc tests inside docstrings
- Python module - unittest library
Creating test_cases with unittest library

specify the -m module for doctests and unittests
For unittest we import unittest and inherit the unittest.TestCase library. Functions have to start with test to be run. 
self.assertEqual function. assertNotEqual, isinstance(), assertRaises
pip install coverage
Coverage.py that checks if you have tested every line of code -- coverage run. coverage report -m, coverage html - can see everything
