Functional Programming in Python:
Just a superpower/tool to add to your toolbox
Ground Rules:
Computation is the evaluation of functions - computing values and outcomes all in functions. Much of our work inside of discrete functions as possible. 
Programming is done with expressions - Use expressions passing output of one function into another using chaining or by assigning the output to a variable and then using that variable
No side effects from computation - no other values changed when function is run
Functions are first class citizens - argument to a function call, and usable as values just like variables are. 
Functions limited in scope and functionality. Well defined purpose, achieve a single task and give the answer from that task
Function -- sorted() -- copy of the list
Map, filter, reduce are paradigms of functional programming
Chaining what makes functional programming powerful.
Reduce applies function to all arguments and returns a final value.
