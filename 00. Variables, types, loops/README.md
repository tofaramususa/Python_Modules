## Variables
Variables in Python are used to store data. They are dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to declare the type of variable before assigning a value to it.

### Variable Naming Conventions
- Must start with a letter or underscore (`_`).
- Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.
- Case-sensitive (`age` and `Age` are different variables).
- Constants are usually written in uppercase (`PI = 3.14`).

### Example
```python
x = 10       # Integer
name = "Alice"  # String
PI = 3.14159  # Constant
```

## Data Types
Python supports several data types, each serving different purposes. Below are some of the basic and advanced data types:

### Basic Data Types
- **int**: Integer values.
- **float**: Floating-point numbers.
- **str**: String literals.
- **bool**: Boolean values (`True` or `False`).

### Collection Data Types
- **list**: Ordered, mutable sequence of elements.
- **tuple**: Ordered, immutable sequence of elements.
- **set**: Unordered collection of unique elements.
- **dict**: Key-value pairs.

### Example
```python
age = 25              # int
height = 5.9          # float
name = "John Doe"     # str
is_student = False    # bool
scores = [85, 90, 95] # list
address = ("123 Main St", "City", "Country")  # tuple
unique_scores = {85, 90, 95}  # set
student = {"name": "John Doe", "age": 25, "is_student": False}  # dict
```

## Everything is an Object
In Python, everything is an object, including variables, functions, and even data types. Each object has attributes (data) and methods (functions) associated with it.

### Example
```python
x = 10
print(x.real)  # Output: 10, accessing the 'real' attribute of the int object
```

## Magic Methods
Magic methods in Python are special methods with double underscores (e.g., `__init__`, `__str__`) that allow you to override or extend the behavior of built-in operations.

### Example: `__str__` Method
```python
class Car:
    def __init__(self, make, model):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.make} {self.model}"

car = Car("Toyota", "Corolla")
print(car)  # Output: Toyota Corolla
```

## String Formatting
Python provides multiple ways to format strings:

### Using `.format()` Method
```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = "Hello, {}!".format(name)
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Alice!
```

### Using f-Strings (Python 3.6+)
```python
name = "Bob"
greeting = f"Hello, {name}!"
print(greeting)  # Output: Hello, Bob!
```

## Type Conversion (Coercion)
Type conversion allows you to convert variables from one type to another using functions like `int()`, `float()`, `str()`.

### Example
```python
x = "100"
y = int(x)  # y becomes an integer 100
```

## Control Flow

### `if`, `elif`, `else` Statements
Used to perform conditional operations.

### Example
```python
x = 10
if x > 0:
    print("Positive")
elif x == 0:
    print("Zero")
else:
    print("Negative")
```

### Logical Operators
- **`and`**: Returns True if both statements are true.
- **`or`**: Returns True if one of the statements is true.
- **`not`**: Reverses the result.

### Example
```python
x = 5
y = 10

if x > 0 and y > 0:
    print("Both numbers are positive")
```

## Loops
Loops are used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dict, set, or string).

### `for` Loop
Iterates over each item in a sequence.

### Example
```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)
```

### `while` Loop
Repeats as long as a condition is true.

### Example
```python
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1
```

## Input and Output
### `input()` Function
Used to take user input as a string.

### Example
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```

### `print()` Function
Used to output data to the console.

### Example
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Error Handling
Python provides a way to handle errors using `try` and `except` blocks.

### Example: Handling `ValueError`
```python
try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
except ValueError:
    print("That's not a valid number!")
```

### Raising Exceptions
You can manually raise an exception using the `raise` keyword.

### Example
```python
def check_age(age):
    if age < 18:
        raise ValueError("Age must be at least 18")
    return True
```
